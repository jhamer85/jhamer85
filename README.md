## ðŸš€ Overview  

This github showcases my growing skillset in data analytics. As part of my career pivot, Iâ€™ve created tools and visualizations to solve real challenges fantasy players faceâ€”from draft planning to identifying value players using statistical insights. A relevant course Capstone project from my IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate is included as well.

Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, fantasy footballer, or hiring manager, I hope these projects give a clear window into how I approach problem-solving, analysis, and user-centric tool design.
